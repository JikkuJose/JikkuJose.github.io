Have been thinking to blog for quite a long time, I hope this attempt won't go futile. It seems recently, I have been wishing quite a lot that I had a blog to share my thoughts.

Though, I suspect my blog to eventually become a rather boring documentation of technical innards that I may have discovered or found exciting enough to share with the world.

So, let me start off by explaining what powers my blog: It is using a simple/nerdy tool called [Jekyll][jekyll]. In a nut shell its a static site generator built by a guy from [GitHub][github]. For the nerdy thats fits the bill, but alas a huge lot to explain for others who might have wandered till here; but I suppose many reading this wouldn't be wondering.
