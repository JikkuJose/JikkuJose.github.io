title: About me 
---

Entrepreneur for nearly 6 years and yet to find what I set out for. But something tells me all this won't go futile. Dreams, hopes and faith have always been the light.

Passionate about philosophy, science and ideas. A decision to never give up. A lot of craziness. Unwavering faith in god. Obsessively curious. Annoyingly frank. -- Ya, thats a weird list!
